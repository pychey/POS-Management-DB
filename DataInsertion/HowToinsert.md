POS Management Database Seeder
This project is an Express.js application designed to populate a MySQL database (pos_management_db) with realistic fake data using the @faker-js/faker library.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (which includes npm)

A running MySQL server

1. File Structure
First, ensure your project files are organized correctly. You should have three main JavaScript files in your project's root directory:

/your-project-folder
|-- index.js         # The main server entry point
|-- model.js         # Handles the database connection
|-- seed.js          # Contains the data seeding logic
|-- package.json     # Manages project dependencies
|-- ...

2. Database Setup
You must have the pos_management_db database and its tables created on your MySQL server. You can use the SQL script provided in the initial request to set this up.

3. Installation
Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and follow these steps:

Initialize the project:
If you don't have a package.json file yet, run this command to create one.

npm init -y

Install dependencies:
This command will download and install Express, the MySQL2 driver, and the Faker library.

npm install express mysql2 @faker-js/faker

4. Configuration
Open the model.js file in your code editor. You must update the dbConfig object with your personal MySQL connection details.

// FILE: model.js

const dbConfig = {
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_mysql_username',  // <-- Replace with your MySQL username
    password: 'your_mysql_password', // <-- Replace with your MySQL password
    database: 'pos_management_db'
};

5. Running the Application
Once the configuration is complete, you can start the web server.

Start the server:
Run the following command from your project's root directory in the terminal.

node index.js

Confirm the server is running:
You should see a confirmation message in your terminal:

Server is running on http://localhost:3000
Visit http://localhost:3000/seed to start the database seeding.

6. Seeding the Database
With the server running, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

http://localhost:3000/seed

This will trigger the seeding script. The page will show a "Starting..." message. For detailed progress, check the output in your terminal window where you ran node index.js. When the process is finished, the browser will display a "Seeding Complete!" message.
